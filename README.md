# 🚀 PRODIGY_GenAI_02 - Text-to-Image Generation

## 📌 Task Description
**Task 2 of Prodigy InfoTech's Generative AI Internship** is focused on generating images from text prompts using a pre-trained generative model. This is achieved using **Stable Diffusion**, a powerful and widely used model for text-to-image generation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Task02_Text_to_Image_StableDiffusion.ipynb` – Main script that generates an image from a text prompt using the Stable Diffusion model.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.
- Output images are displayed using `matplotlib`.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Stable Diffusion v1.4**  
  Source: `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4`  
  Library: [`diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch

🎯 Output
The model will generate an image based on your prompt. For example:

Prompt: "A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars"

Output: A high-quality AI-generated image matching the description.
