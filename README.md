# 🧠 PRODIGY_GenAI_02 – Text Summarization with T5

This is Task 2 of the **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To implement **abstractive text summarization** using the pre-trained **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)** model from Hugging Face. The model summarizes long text into concise, meaningful sentences.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Hugging Face Transformers
- T5-small Model

---

## 📁 Files
- `PRODIGY_GenAI_Task02_T5Summarization.ipynb` – Colab notebook with code and output

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Learned how the T5 model converts NLP tasks into a unified text-to-text format
- Gained hands-on experience with summarization pipelines in Hugging Face
- Understood how pre-trained models can be adapted for specific tasks
